# 🖐️ Virtual Control AI – Gesture & Voice-Controlled Virtual Mouse

**Virtual Control AI** is a real-time gesture recognition system that allows hands-free control of your computer using hand gestures and voice commands. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, it enables intuitive interactions such as mouse movement, left/right clicks, and scrolling—all controlled by gestures. Voice commands toggle gesture recognition on or off.

🎯 **Key Features**

* 🖱️ Real-time gesture-based virtual mouse control
* 🗣️ Voice-activated gesture system using SpeechRecognition
* 🤖 Powered by CNN models and MediaPipe
* 🎯 90%+ gesture accuracy on diverse hand datasets
* 🧑‍🦽 Improves accessibility by 50%
